# Roll_a_Ball_Final2-main
Added Ramp and Material Assets//
Discovered that everytime I downloaded the repo from github to work on it from a different computer than the NSCC labs it messed up the repo and made a new one, so the changes look sporadic. I've spent nearly three hours trying (and failing, then destroying, then panicking, then fixing) to fix the issues, but I was only partially successful. What I've learned it to be very, very cautious of file management and test the repo on the github site just as often as a playtested the game. //
Because I can't recover the previous repos (I think I permanently deleted a chunk of it) I'll document some learning I did here for myself:
Save in five minute incremements. And before script changes. And after.//
The Asset store is a great resource, but you don't need to download all of the assets in the folder, just the ones you know you'll use.//
Probuilder is a tricky beast, but trial and error is my friend.//
So many issues I had were caused by overthinking. Sometimes the answer really is just the simplest one. //
Bring my laptop to work periods to test the GitHub repos before I leave campus and make changes to the project on a different computer. //
The wireframe tool is in fact very useful and not a useless gimmick. Consider me humbled.//
Take screenshots AS YOU ARE WORKING because you forget so, so much. //
Often times YouTube tutorials are clearer than the forum ones. //
Make sure you have the right terminology during google searches. Turns out specifically saying respawn yields more results than asking how you make the ball bounce back. //
However much time you think it will take, it will take longer.
